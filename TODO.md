# TO DO:
- Move cumulative change detection from AttributeComponent to DataCharacter/Npc.writeData?
    - Woukd need a new Property protocol to handle accumulation, but can default this to take-newest
    - Really only need it for HP and SP, this might be overkill and lots of unnecessary data flying around
    - But it would centralise the HP change detector, useful for when typed damage is implemented so I don't have to handle wound detection in two places
    - Unless I pass in the final typed damage to the atrribute bar and handle it from there
    - Better to pass data up than down though, do it at the root
- Deprecate 'REQUIRED_PROPERTIES', replace with per-component property initialisation
- Global 'New Round' button on menubar
    - AP -> 3
    - Attacks made -> 0
    - Stamina Spent -> false
- Override property button to save against NPC
- Skill roller
- Deal damage dialog / auto-handle typed damaged esp. vs. armour
- Auto wound detection based on AttributeBar.onChange
- Wound display
- Info copy for roll20 tooltip
- Equipment manager
    - Left hand / right hand drop down
    - Use item button -- attack/block/parry?
    - List of special ability/traits/talents/spells
